### Task 1 - Web scraping to gain company insights

Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.

This first task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.

Customer review data for Britis Airways was collected from [Skytrax](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways).

Following insights were uncovered as they are summed up in the one slide presentation.

### Task 2 - Predicting customer buying behaviour

Customers are more empowered than ever because they have access to a wealth of information at their fingertips. This is one of the reasons the buying cycle is very different to what it used to be. Today, if you’re hoping that a customer purchases your flights or holidays as they come into the airport, you’ve already lost! Being reactive in this situation is not ideal; airlines must be proactive in order to acquire customers before they embark on their holiday.

This task involves building a high quality predictive to predict the successful bookings using customer bookings data.
